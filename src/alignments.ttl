# This file provides alignments from RDF-STaX to other ontologies and vocabularies.
# They are kept separate from the main ontology file, as they may violate the OWL 2 DL profile.

# Alignments to the SPARQL Service Description vocabulary
# The sd:Dataset and sd:Graph classes represent datasets and graphs from RDF 1.1. They are
# however classes, whereas the corresponding entities in RDF-STaX are instances.
# This is consistent with the SKOS model, which allows concepts to be either instances or classes.
