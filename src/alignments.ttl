# This file provides alignments from RDF-STaX to other ontologies and vocabularies.
# They are kept separate from the main ontology file, as they may violate the OWL 2 DL profile.

# Alignment to the SPARQL Service Description vocabulary
# The sd:Dataset and sd:Graph classes represent datasets and graphs from RDF 1.1. They are
# however classes, whereas the corresponding entities in RDF-STaX are instances.
# This is consistent with the SKOS model, which allows concepts to be either instances or classes.
stax:dataset skos:relatedMatch sd:Dataset .
stax:graph skos:relatedMatch sd:Graph .

# Alignment to the VoCaLS vocabulary
# The vocals:RDFStream class corresponds to the definition of an RDF graph stream or a flat RDF
# triple stream in RDF-STaX (depending on how you interpret the definition of the class).
# This is a (loosely) related match, as the term in VoCaLS is a class, and not an instance.
stax:flatTripleStream skos:relatedMatch vocals:RDFStream .
stax:graphStream skos:relatedMatch vocals:RDFStream .

# Alignment to the VoID vocabulary
# The void:Dataset class is a set of triples with additional context information. Therefore, it
# can be viewed as a flat RDF triple stream in RDF-STaX.
# This is a (loosely) related match, as the term in VoID is a class, and not an instance.
stax:flatTripleStream skos:relatedMatch void:Dataset .

# Alignment with the LDES vocabulary
# The ldes:EventStream class is by definition a a collection of stream elements â€“ sets of RDF 
# triples. Each element is identified with its subject node. Therefore, instances of this class
# can be annotated in RDF-STaX as RDF subject graph streams.
# This is a (loosely) related match, as the term in LDES is a class, and not an instance.
