**Analyzing the state of the art of RDF streaming.** This use case is realized with [RDF-STaX's Nanopublication mechanism](../nanopubs.md), which allows anyone to publish statements like "paper/software X uses stream type Y". The collection of such published nanopublications can then be later used to derive insights about the state of the art (SOTA) of RDF streaming. RDF-STaX can also be used in SOTA investigations outside the context of Nanopublications.
