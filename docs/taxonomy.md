# Taxonomy overview

The diagram below is an overview of the RDF Stream Taxonomy (RDF-STaX). Each term in the diagram is represented by an instance of the `#!turtle stax:RdfStreamType` class in the [RDF-STaX ontology](ontology.md). The ontology also contains the formal definitions of each stream type.

You can find a detailed discussion on the taxonomy, formal definitions, its usage, and its mapping to other research in the **[RDF-STaX paper]()**. TODO TODO TODO!
