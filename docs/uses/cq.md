# Competency question tests

The following competency question tests are based on the use cases of RDF-STaX. The tests are implemented as SPARQL queries and are used in Continuous Integration (CI) to test the RDF-STaX ontology whenever any change to it is made. The following list is generated automatically based on the tests [defined in the main RDF-STaX repository](https://github.com/RDF-STaX/rdf-stax.github.io/tree/main/tests).

The documentation for creating new tests is available [here](../contributing.md#competency-question-tests).
