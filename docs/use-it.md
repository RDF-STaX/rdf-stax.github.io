# How to use RDF-STaX?

RDF stream type usage is often a subjective matter, so RDF-STaX provides [facilities](ontology.md) for making *subjective* assertions about RDF stream types. For example: *I see this resource as an RDF graph stream, because (...)*, as opposed to strict, universal classification.

The assertions can be made by anyone, anywhere â€“ be it in the metadata of your resource, when discussing research works and software, or elsewhere.

## Annotating RDF stream types

Making a statement about something's RDF stream type is very straightforward. For example, to say that `#!turtle <https://example.org/some-resource>` is an RDF graph stream, you would use the following RDF:

```turtle
@prefix stax: <https://w3id.org/stax/ontology#> .

_:usage a stax:RdfStreamTypeUsage ;
    stax:usesStreamType stax:rdfGraphStream ;
    stax:usedIn <https://example.org/some-resource> .
```

It is recommended (but not required) to have one `#!turtle stax:RdfStreamTypeUsage` instance per annotated resource and per RDF stream type. This makes it easier to find all the annotations for a given resource or stream type.

You can also make the statement in reverse, by annotating the resource itself:

```turtle
@prefix stax: <https://w3id.org/stax/ontology#> .

<https://example.org/some-resource> stax:hasStreamTypeUsage [
    a stax:RdfStreamTypeUsage ;
    stax:usesStreamType stax:rdfGraphStream
] .
```

The `#!turtle stax:RdfStreamTypeUsage` instance is a good place to put additional information about the usage, such as a textual explanation, the source of the information, or the author of the statement. For example:

```turtle
@prefix cito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/> .
@prefix dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
@prefix stax: <https://w3id.org/stax/ontology#> .

_:usage a stax:RdfStreamTypeUsage ;
    rdfs:comment "The authors state that for their proposed system, 'the streaming element (i.e. a single message) (...) is a set of triples'. Therefore, it uses an RDF graph stream."@en ;
    stax:usesStreamType stax:rdfGraphStream ;
    stax:usedIn <https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSTCC.2017.8107003> ;
    cito:citesAsEvidence <https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSTCC.2017.8107003> ;
    dcterms:creator <https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2543-9461> .
```

You can use whatever properties you like, however, the following are recommended:

- [CITO ontology](http://purl.org/spar/cito/) for typing the citations.
- [DCMI Metadata Terms](http://purl.org/dc/terms/) for the statement author information.
- `#!turtle rdfs:comment` for the textual explanation.
- For statement creators, we recommend using [ORCID](https://orcid.org/).
- For research works, we recommend using [DOI](https://www.doi.org/).

## Making RDF stream type usage nanopublications

This *subjective* style of RDF-STaX meshes very well with the idea of [nanopublications](https://nanopub.net/), small snippets of scientific knowledge. See the [documentation page on nanopublications](nanopubs.md) for more information on how to find, use, and create them.
