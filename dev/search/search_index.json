For example, to say that <code>&lt;https://example.org/some-resource&gt;</code> is an RDF graph stream, you would use the <code>stax:RdfStreamTypeUsage</code> class:</p> <pre><code>@prefix stax: &lt;https://w3id.org/stax/ontology#&gt; .\n\n_:usage a stax:RdfStreamTypeUsage ;\n    stax:hasStreamType stax:graphStream ;\n    stax:isUsageOf &lt;https://example.org/some-resource&gt; .\n</code></pre> <p>It is recommended (but not required) to have one <code>stax:RdfStreamTypeUsage</code> instance per annotated resource and per RDF stream type. This makes it easier to find all the annotations for a given resource or stream type.</p> <p>You can also make the statement in reverse, by annotating the resource itself. This can be especially useful when annotating RDF streams on the Web or in a dataset. The following three examples illustrate combining RDF-STaX with other vocabularies for describing datasets and streams (VoCaLS, VoID, DCAT, LDES). RDF-STaX here plays the role of a bridge between the different ontologies, providing a way to describe stream types in a universal manner.</p> Example: VoCaLS <code>RDFStream</code> (click to expand) <p>To annotate a <code>vocals:RDFStream</code> from the VoCaLS Vocabulary:</p> <pre><code>@prefix stax: &lt;https://w3id.org/stax/ontology#&gt; .\n@prefix vocals: &lt;http://w3id.org/rsp/vocals#&gt; .\n\n_:stream a vocals:RDFStream ;\n    # ... other properties of the stream ...\n    stax:hasStreamTypeUsage [\n        a stax:RdfStreamTypeUsage ;\n        stax:hasStreamType stax:graphStream\n    ] .\n</code></pre> <p>VoCaLS defines <code>vocals:RDFStream</code> as \"a stream composed of RDF data elements, i.e. RDF graphs and/or triples\". Instances of this class can be thus annotated as RDF graph stream or flat RDF triple streams.</p> Example: VoID <code>Dataset</code> (click to expand) <p>To annotate a <code>void:Dataset</code> from the VoID Vocabulary:</p> <pre><code>@prefix stax: &lt;https://w3id.org/stax/ontology#&gt; .\n@prefix void: &lt;http://rdfs.org/ns/void#&gt; .\n\n_:dataset a void:Dataset ;\n    # ... other properties of the dataset ...\n    stax:hasStreamTypeUsage [\n        a stax:RdfStreamTypeUsage ;\n        stax:hasStreamType stax:flatTripleStream\n    ] .\n</code></pre> <p>In VoID, <code>void:Dataset</code> refers to a set of triples, which can be viewed as a flat RDF triple stream.</p> Example: DCAT <code>Distribution</code> (click to expand) <p>In DCAT, a dataset may have multiple representations (<code>dcat:Distribution</code>). Thus, tou may want to annotate the distribution, not the dataset itself:</p> <pre><code>@prefix dcat: &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#&gt; .\n@prefix stax: &lt;https://w3id.org/stax/ontology#&gt; .\n\n_:dataset a dcat:Dataset ;\n    # ... other properties of the dataset ...\n    dcat:distribution [\n        a dcat:Distribution ;\n        # ... other properties of the distribution ...\n        stax:hasStreamTypeUsage [\n            a stax:RdfStreamTypeUsage ;\n            stax:hasStreamType stax:datasetStream\n        ]\n    ] .\n</code></pre> <p>Of course, annotating the dataset itself also makes sense, if you want to make a statement about the dataset as a whole.</p> <p>In DCAT, all RDF stream types from RDF-STaX are applicable, depending on the content of the dataset.</p> Example: LDES <code>EventStream</code> (click to expand) <p>In Linked Data Event Streams (LDES) the <code>ldes:EventStream</code> is a collection of stream elements \u2013 sets of RDF triples. Each element is identified with its subject node.
